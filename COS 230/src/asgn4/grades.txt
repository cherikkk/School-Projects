Grade for Asg4 - Dictionary
Chris Lenk 
Overall most excellent, the delete works, the splay tree
works, the code is nicely readable.

Doing a find on a word which is not in the dictionary
causes the program to blow up.  I did not remove points
but its not good.

Good coding style, including indentation, comments, 
and variable name                            05/05

Christopher's notes: 

did have multi-defs, just didnt print them on find [word] (they show up in the "tree" command)

search() returns null if node not found, but I forgot to check for null where it gets returned to
